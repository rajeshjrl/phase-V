Below is the information
freenode isn't affiliated with www.Cryptosi.com and we will not have added any chat features to the site. I've just had a quick look around and haven't been able to find any chat feature either?

If you would like to connect to freenode without using a real irc client then there are various web clients available. We provide http://webchat.freenode.net/ which may be embedded within websites. Just click the 'IRC' speech bubble logo top left and then "Add webchat to your site." from the dropdown.

Before doing this I would strongly advise reading http://blog.freenode.net/2008/04/registering-a-channel-on-freenode/ and following the instructions within. Doing so before directing users to your channel will benefit everyone involved in the running of the channel. I would particularly point out freenode's policy page at http://freenode.net/policy.shtml There are several important sections listed including what we consider 'ontopic' as well as our channel naming policy.
